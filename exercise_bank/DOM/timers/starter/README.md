## Stop Watch

We've been tasked with building out the behavior for a digital stopwatch, the interface for which is in `index.html`. 

####Client Specs
* When "Start" is clicked, the text "Stop Watch" should be replaced by "Time elapsed: 0", and the count should increment every second.
* When "Reset" is clicked, the text should return to "Stop Watch"
* When "Pause" is clicked, the text should say "Time elapsed: 1", but stop incrementing.

####Directions
Spend 10 minutes looking at [JavaScript Timers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Timers), then check out the specific documentation for `setInterval` and `clearInterval`.
