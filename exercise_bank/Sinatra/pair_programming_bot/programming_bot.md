# The Pair Programming Bot

####Learning Objectives:

Students get practice writing routes, passing parameters, working with params, and using ERB (Embedded Ruby templates

#### Prompt:

- You are going to recreate the [Pair Programming Bot](http://pair-programming-bot.herokuapp.com/) from scratch using Sinatra, meaning each page will either have a 'YES/NO' option or a 'DONE' option, and each option will link to the appropriate page. 

#### Helpful Hints from a Benevolent Alum

- Draw a flow chart for the app's behavior before you code a word. Check out [this flowchart example](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8160/7214525854_733237dd83_z.jpg) for flowchart inspiration.

- You should use ERB templates to keep your code DRY. Ask yourself what types of pages you will need a template for?

- For each of the templates that you use, think about what information you will need to pass in using instance variables.

- Styling is secondary, so don't start styling until your app works. (Don't put lipstick on a pig.)
