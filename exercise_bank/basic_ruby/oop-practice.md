# What to do:

- Write out 3 class declarations:
  - a __Shirt__ class
    - upon __instantiation__ (meaning the creation of a new object of the `Shirt` class), the class's `initialize` method should take 3 arguments: 
      - `size`
      - `color`
      - `text`
      - ^^^^^^__Set these arguments to instance variables of the same name in the initialize method__
    - instantiate a new shirt, `pearl_jam_t`, which is extra-large, a nicely faded black, and says "Yield Tour 1998"
    - instantiate another new shirt, `hipster_plaid` which is size medium, the color red, says "NO LOGO" on the back
    - instantiate another new shirt, `david_beckham_jersey` which is large, white, and has the text "Beckham"
  - a __Car__ class
    - upon instantiation, the Car class's `initialize` method should take 4 arguments and set them to instance variables.
      - `year`
      - `brand`
      - `model`
      - `color`
    - write an __instance method__ called `start_engine` that returns the string `"Vrum vrum vrum!"`
    - instantiate a new car, `dads_miata`, which is a red Miata and was produced by Mazda in 1992.
      - call `dads_miata`'s `start_engine` method
    - instantiate another new car, `all_electric_dreamcar`, which is a black Model-S and was produced by Tesla Motors earlier this year. 
    - instantiate one more car, `travs_first_car`, which was a maroon 1995 Oldsmobile Cutlass Cierra SL.
  - a __Concert__ class
    - upon instantiation, the Concert class's initialize method should take 4 arguments:
      - `band`
      - `city`
      - `venue`
      - `date`
    - instantiate a new concert, `best_night_of_life`, that represents Built to Spill's performance at the Metro in Chicago on May 8th, 2005.
    - instantiate a new concert, `embarrassing_first_concert`, which took place in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in like 1998 at the Marcus Amphitheater. The band? Sugar Ray.
