#Shopping List

##Learning Objectives:
- Write a class with an initialize method
- Write getter and setter methods
- Write a method that accepts arguments
- Modify objects attributes with a method
- Use different datatypes as attributes

##Prompt
- The holidays are on their way! Using what we know so far, make an interactive program that allows a user to create a shopping list. We're assuming that the user wants to make lists for grocery shopping, gifts shopping, etc. The list should have a title.

- The program should start by prompting the following options:
    
    1- Create new shopping list (the new list should have a title)
    2- Edit list's name
    3- See all items
    4- Add new item
    6- Exit

###Bonus
- Add an option to remove a specific item from the list
- Think of ways to associate quantity to the item's name (hashes, anyone?)
