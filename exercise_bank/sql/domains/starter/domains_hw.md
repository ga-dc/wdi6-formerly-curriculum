# Domain Modeling HW

For each of the following, read the domain description, then model it into a problem with entities and relationships. You will begin by drawing an ERD diagram and critically examining it. From your ERD diagram, design a database schema. For each domain, create the SQL file you would use to create the tables.

###Travel Log
You are building an app to help you keep track of our travels. The app will allow you to write journal entries and tag each entry with the city you're writing in. This should allow you to go back and retrive all entries for a particular locale.

###Photo Management App
A professional photographer needs a web app to help share her photographs with her clients. She often takes wedding photos, but also does couples and family photos. She keeps photos in an album for each event and shares the event with her clients.

###Figure Skating
You are building an app to help with the Winter Olympics, specifically the figure skating event. Your app will keep track of the skaters and the scores they receive from each of the judges. 

###Snapchat
Instagram is SO last year. We're going to build a web app that allows us to add friends, and then to take Snapshots and send them to any number of our friends.

###The Bachelor
ABC needs you to develop an app to manage their totally awesome hit show, The Bachelor. Each season of The Bachelor has 1 bachelor, 25 eligible women, and 9 episodes. Each episode has a rose ceremony in which the bachelor gives roses to the woman he likes. (The women who do not receive roses are eliminated.) In the finale, the Bachelor chooses between the last two women, proposing to the one he likes best. After the show, sometimes the marriage actually transpires, and sometimes it doesn't. (We want to be able to track whether or not it happens.)

## Bonus

###Jeopardy
NBC has hired you to create an app that manages Jeopardy Episodes. Each episode has 3 contestants and 3 rounds (1 Jeopardy Round, 1 Double Jeopardy Round, and 1 Final Jeopardy Round). Each of the first two rounds has 6 categories. Each category has 5 questions (they're really answers), each of which have a dollar value and a correct answer (they're really questions). Contestants need to be able to answer questions, and either be docked or receive the dollar amount that the question (answer) is worth. In Final Jeopardy, each contestant gets to answer the same question, and rather than this question having a static value like all the rest, the contestants can wager their current total, but no more.
