# 9:10 - 9:35, Brian + Staff
## Introduce GA

- Who takes this class? Three archetypes
  - Wants to become a developer that we would want to hire. Plans on using Outcomes to pursue job placement.
  - Wants to become a developer that we would want to hire. Plans on pursuing or continuing job placement without Outcomes.
  - Wants to absorb as much knowledge as possible about development.

This class's only requirements are for qualifying for Outcomes. As long as you do not create an environment that precludes others from learning, nothing will preclude you from being able to attend class.

### What does it mean for a student to qualify for Outcomes?
- They have the highest career-placement priority with Outcomes.
- They may present at the Meet and Hire.

### To qualify for Outcomes:

- Have been absent no more than 4 days
- Have been tardy no more than 8 days
- Have completed 80% of homework
- Additionally, earn no more than 1 "does not meet expectations" on Projects 1-3.
- What about Project 4?
  - That's "your project". It marks the transition between us starting to make you a good developer, and you having to take yourself the rest of the way through your career.

- We can't make you do anything. But it would behoove you to participate in outcomes.
  - All three archetypes paid the same amount for this class
  - GA DC has the best Outcomes coordination of any GA campus in the world
  - Unless you have no intention whatsoever of advancing in your professional life, you would benefit greatly from participating in Outcomes programming

### To clarify
- What are "absent" and "tardy"?
  - There is no excused **anything**. This is why we give you 4 days to be absent and 8 days to be tardy.
  - This class is drinking from a firehose. Miss one half a day and you'll spend a lot of time trying to catch up.
  - Please **do not** miss between Thursday of Week 3 and Thursday of Week 4.
- What is "complete"?
  - You made a clear effort to solve the homework yourself. If you pulled code from somewhere, you annotated your code saying where you pulled it from. No plagiarism. We can tell.
- What is "does not meet expectations"?
  - Each project will have a rubric.

### Refund policy
  - Up to W07D01, you may drop and get a refund on a sliding scale

## Growth Mindset

[Growth Mindset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_oqghnxBmY_)
- For many students, this is the most mentally challenging thing they've ever done in their lives.
  - This is the first time they've been bad at something.
  - How many people have failed at something? I imagine that everyone has. At some point in this course you will falter. But that's OK! It's how we bounce back, persevere and learn from it that allows our mind to grow.
  - [Emotional Cycle of Change](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/3c/f4/fa/3cf4faeb2078f4f4fbb9265444bde2e0.jpg)
    - uninformed optimism
    - informed pessimism
    - determination/commitment or giving up
    - hopeful realism
    - informed optimism

- Just memorizing stuff won't help you. Learning HOW to code will.
  - You can't BS your way through code.
  - The fundamental standard of programming: It either works, or it doesn't. No amount of sweet-talking will make it work.
  - Programming is a mindset. It's about confidence and being open to failure. It's about being able to say, "Eh, I'm going to try this thing, even though I don't really understand it. AND I'm not going to get attached to it in case it doesn't work and I have to erase all my code and try something completely different."

- So many students throughout my time here say, "I don't know how to do that." or some variation of that. Many of you will say it. Just add "...yet" to it.
- We as instructors anticipate that you will run into hardships. When you do, don't run for the hills! Buckle down and work through the problem. Embrace the fact that the hardship will make you a better coder. Endure the struggle to grow and develop your mind.

## What is an immersive course?

### WE DO

T&T: What's different about an immersive environment?

- What does it mean to be in a "immersive course"?
  - You will be asked to do things that are uncomfortable.
    - *(Note that when I say "do things", I mean classes and projects, nothing weird.)*
  - You can't "win" -- and can't lose!
    - This is a noncompetitive environment.
  - You will be re-learning how to learn.
    - The last time you spent 9 hours a day learning something new was in high school.
  - Cooperation
    - You'll be eating and living together for the next 12 weeks!
  - Balance
    - Hygeine!
  - We will not give up on you
    - Even when you might have given up on yourself!
    - None of the instructors are here just to collect a paycheck. We're nerds, about web development, education, and you.
  - Trust that our decisions are informed by solid experience.
    - In industry
    - At GA
    - We rely on your feedback. At the same time, we ultimately have to trust in our own experience and expertise first.
  - Ultimately, we ask you to **trust us and each other.**
    - Trust that we have each other's best interests at heart.
    - But we expect to have to work to earn that trust.

Note that none of the above mention anything about code.

# 11:00 - 11:05, Adrian
## What is asking for help?

- This is the thing students find the hardest, and the thing that ultimately determines whether or not they will be successful in this class.
- Without fail, the students who do not ask for help do the poorest in the class.

### YOU DO

I'm going to ask you to write something on a letter-sized piece of paper. You are allowed no more than 12 words. Please write big enough that someone can read your paper from a few feet away.

When you are done, you will put the paper face-down on your table and leave the room. We'll start again at 11:15.

Now, close your eyes. I want you to write what first comes to mind when I ask you to think of a time you had to ask for help.

*(Collect papers, tape to board for students to review as they re-enter.)*

# 11:05 - 11:10, Adrian
## Break

# 11:10 - 11:15, Adrian
## Asking for help

- We have all asked for help. There's no shame in it. Feeling afraid to ask for help will be the biggest detriment in this class.
- What makes asking for help effective?
  - Asking a clear problem. "I don't know any of this" isn't a clear problem. "I tried this thing and got this error" is a clear problem.
  - We will turn you away when:
      - The question you're asking isn't constructive
      - It's clear you haven't made an effort to find the answer
          - First, try it yourself
          - Then, Google it
          - Then, ask your neighbor
          - Finally, ask an instructor

# 11:20 - 11:30, Matt
## Student Constitution

Let's talk about our social contract.  What are your expecations?  What does respect mean to you?

### Write, Group, Share: What are your rights and responsibilities?

Prompts:
- We want a community that...
- What are your rights and responsibilities?
- What does respect mean to you?

Some items from past constitutions:
- empathy/respect, how to build it
- helping each other
- personal hygiene
- tardiness
- personal effort

## Write (2 min)

- Individuals write on post-its

## Group (5 min)

- Get in group
- Share on Whiteboard
- Vote for 2 (prefer one right, one responsibility)

### Share/Record it! (~2 min @ group)

- Two representatives from each group (one for each) write these on the front whiteboard & describe/clarify
  - please write legibly, this is our record.
- Picture
- Slack it out

## Class content

### How the Class is Built

GA has built a baseline curriculum, which includes topics to cover, and a
suggested order. As a local campus, we have built on and modified this
curriculum based on own experiences as instructors, and the unique features
of the DC job market. Each lesson is designed by the instructor that's
delivering it.

We also iterate on this curriculum constantly, so technologies,  concepts, etc,
change with each cohort. Last cohort started with Ruby, but as JS becomes more
and more important, we've started teaching JS first, switching to Ruby, then
back to JS.

### Course Content

Exercise: Ask students to list technologies / languages that they think are
involved in web development. Examples: HTML, Ruby, Databases, etc.

Map out the technologies and how they relate to each other. Lead a discussion
on which technologies we'll cover, why we chose those, and why we can't cover
everything.

Technologies we cover:

* HTML
* CSS / SASS
* JavaScript
* Ruby
* PostgreSQL (Relational Database)
* MongoDB (NoSQL Database)
* Rails
* Node.js / Express
* Backbone.js / Handlebars Templates

We cover these technologies / topics because they are foundational to web
development, and learning the underlying concepts of how they work prepares you
to learn and work in any web development technologies.

### Course Sequence

This course has been pretty well-planned for all 12 weeks, but this is subject
to change.

The course is organized by units of roughly 1 week each. Every 3 weeks, we'll
complete a project (~3-5 days each).

Units/Projects:
* Front-end Fundamentals (HTML/CSS/JS)
* Intermediate Front-end (Intermediate JavaScript / jQuery)
* Project 1 - Build an application using HTML / CSS / JS
* Ruby / Data Persistance / Backend Dev w/ Sinatra
* Full-stack MVC w/ Rails
* Project 2 - Build a full-stack, data driven app w/ Rails
* Collaborative Development (UXDi) / Adv. Front-end (JS, CSS, SASS)
* APIs with Rails and Express
* Project 3 - Build a backend API and Front-end that consumes it
* Users and Authentication in APIs
* MVW with Backbone.js
* Project 4 - Portfolio project

## Class logistics

- Pods
  - Class is split alphabetically into 6 pods
  - There will be 3 pods per classroom
  - The pods that are together will be rotated after every project so that each pod will have been with each other pod
  - Each pod will have one instructor for the duration of the course.
    - This is the instructor with whom you'll do one-on-ones
- Class staggering
  - Usually, a lesson will be taught twice by the same instructor. So I'll teach HTML this afternoon to one class, and then HTML tomorrow to the other.
  - We'll all have the same lessons and the same homework. Who had what when will just vary by a day or two between the classes.
- One-on-ones
  - Each student will be scheduled one half-hour slot every two weeks during which they will meet with an instructor.
  - Talk about whatever needs to be talked about
  - Should you need additional meetings with instructors, each instructor has open one-on-one time once per week:
    - **Jesse**: Thursday @ 5pm - 5:30pm
- Office Hours
  - Led exclusively by TAs
    - These TAs are outstanding former students from the previous class
  - Usually 4 nights a week, from 5:30 until 7:30
- Instructor Communication
  - Instructors **may not** respond to code questions on Slack nor in-person after 6pm each night, even if we're in the office
  - Should you have a logistical question, you may contact the **Student Communication Manager**
    - This is Robin.
  - All code questions should go to TAs
    - **Question** why would we do this?
    - Answer: Work Life Balance.
  - Student communication manager
    - If you have logistical questions or concerns, contact me (Robin)
- Homework and assessments
  - You'll probably have one homework per lesson, so if you have two lessons in a day, that's two homeworks, graded separately.
  - Homework will be graded only for *completeness*. That is, you actually attempted it yourself and didn't copy code. If you want more feedback, you'll need to ask for it.
  - There will be one homework per week on which your pod leader will leave comments.
  - **Question**: Is it a problem that you'll likely be able to see solutions to homework assignments before you have to do them yourself?
- Absences and Tardies
  - Having more than 4 absences disqualifies you for Outcomes
  - 4 Tardies == 1 Absence
  - Class starts at 9:00am
  - If you arrive after 9:00am, please wait outside the classroom until the next break.
    - You will be marked tardy.
    - We will likely be doing a morning exercise, which you'll be able to find in the class repo.

### The schedule
- 9-10 Warmup
- 10:12:30 Lesson
- 1:30-4 Lesson
- 4-5 Homework assigned, warm-down
- 5-5:30 One-on-one

- Tuesday
  - Outcomes programming from 3pm onward

- Friday
  - From 9 to 11 will be optional review and an optional mini-lesson
    - mini-lessons will cover advanced, but orthoganal material to the course.
    - If you don't want to come in until 11, then don't. But if you're struggling, the onus is on you to take advantage of the opportunity.
    - Quizzes will be weekly at 11
  - Lab most of day
