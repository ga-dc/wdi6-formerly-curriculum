### Callbacks

- Explain the concept of a 'callback' function and how we can pass functions as arguments to other functions.
- Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous execution.
- Explain why callbacks are important to asynchronous program flow.
- Identify when to reference a function and when to invoke a function.
- Describe what an anonymous function is and when you would use one.
- Pass a named function as a callback to another function.
- Pass an anonymous function as a callback to another function.
- Define a function that takes a function as an argument and invokes the argument when the function is called.

### Scope

- Define 'scope' in the context of programming.
- Describe the impact of hoisting on variable scope.

### Context

- Explain Javascript 'context' and what the value of the 'this' keyword refers to.
