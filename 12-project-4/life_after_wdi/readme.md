### Me and my ADD

I have been diagnosed with ADD.  Like many things, it's a strength and a weakness.  I am easily distracted, but I also have a penchant for intense focus, and can get "lost" in any problem.  I can ignore food and bathroom breaks, completely missing the passage of time for many hours - like a whole work day.  It was worse when I was younger, but it was easier to be functional. My schedule was more flexible and my highs made up for my lows.  When I was "on", I could make up for many hours of distraction in a short period of time.  Once I got a 9-5 job, my highs were cut-off and the environment encouraged my lows.  That's when I joined an ADD research study at NIH to see what I could do to correct for it.  Aw man - my initial observation is a story to share.  It was tough to admit it, but it was even tougher to continue living as only half a person.  I couldn't do the things I wanted to do, let alone needed to.  It's still with me, but at a lessor level.

I see it most when when I don't take care of myself.  I need my sleep, my food, my rest, my fun.

Why am I sharing this?  Why am I embarrassing myself up here?

### This field attracts intelligent and introverted people who may be more prone to social anxiety, depression and ADD.

Let me say that again,

This field attracts intelligent and introverted people who may be more prone to social anxiety, depression and ADD.

It's a thing.

I'm sharing because others have shared, giving me the courage to share.  I want you to know that you are not alone.  Whatever you are battling does not have to get between you and success.  It is, almost certainly, a strength and a weakness.  I also have a cautionary tale.  We fix things for a living.  We have lost people, great people from our community because they attempted to fix themselves and were not successful.  Please, if you are in this boat, or even think you might be, discuss it with a professional.

On a slightly lighter note.

### We are better, if everyone is here

You are entering a world dominated by, well, male geeks.  In some cases, we've created our own world, with our own social norms.  And we were happy here.

But... it excluded people.  People that were different felt unwelcome.  We don't want that.  I hope you will see that your development community is actively working on it.  Conferences and companies are sharing a Code of Conduct, so that, at the very least, people aren't acting out of ignorance.  It's helped a lot.

It works both ways.  You may work with people that don't fit your social norms.  Please be aware that they may simple not know or may have a condition.  Find out.  Talk to them in private.  Support their growth.  Make sure your company is talking about these things.

Sunlight is the best disinfectant.

## 4:55 - Grow Your Network, Sharpen Skills, and Earn Extra Cash (Robin)

That is -- teach!

The first class I taught was a free "Intro to Web Design" in the basement of the Shaw Library, about a year and a half ago. I didn't know much except basic HTML, CSS, and jQuery (not Vanilla JS) -- where you guys were at the end of Week 1. Most of the "students" were older than I was. I was nervous and didn't teach very well. But the students were so appreciative!

I got many contacts out of that one free lesson, which turned into friendships and paid work later on, which turned into motivation to keep on teaching. The questions students asked highlighted the gaps in my knowledge, and gave me things to work on at a point when I was feeling very "stuck" in my career. Eventually, my classes snowballed into a job at GA.

I think teaching is the best thing you can do for your career at this point, and maybe at all points. Teaching will show you both what you don't know, and what you thought you didn't know that you actually do. You may be a new developer, but you're light years ahead of 99% of the world — and that 99% desperately wants the skills you now have.

And you're not just a developer. You had a career before you came to GA. You have much more knowledge and experience than just WDI. That gives you a perspective that's extraordinary both among teachers, and among the other folks interviewing for development jobs. With each cohort I have the opportunity to learn about the unique careers and experiences of 60 different people!

Don't underestimate yourself. The best thing you can do right now -- for yourself, and for others -- is to go out and teach.

## 5:00 - Stay Hungry (Adam)

* Stay hungry... there's always:
	* more to learn
	* a better way to do what you're trying to do
	* entire worlds / paradigms in programming that you've probably never heard of, let alone understand
* Become Mediocre: That is, surround yourself with better developers.
	* Work
		* Work will be one way to do this for many of you, but you may not be so lucky, and at some point, you may be the best developer at your company (crazy, right?)
	* Non-work Peers
		* Attend meetups, conferences, etc.
	* Find a mentor
		* The good news is that there are lots of people who know a lot about programming, and may be willing to mentor you.
		* Finding a mentor isn't easy, but some things might help:
		  * work in the open
		  	* people giving feedback on a github commit is valuable, and could lead to longer discussions on code
		  	* people are more willing to help those who help others
		  * serve as a mentor for others
		    * many of you are fortunate to have some structured ways in which you'll be helping others, for those of you who don't, seek out organizations devoted to helping people
		    	* they often have training / resources
		    * teaching is a fantastic way to improve your skills
		  	* people are more willing to help those who help others
* Find an accountabili-buddy: set measurable, achievable goals for yourself.
	* Walk through [leveling up as a developer](http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2011/08/09/programming-achievements-how-to-level-up-as-a-developer/)
	* Learn a variety of programming paradigms:
	* Experience the ins and outs of programming for different platforms:
	* Enhance your understanding of the building blocks that we use as developers:
	* Enlighten yourself with koans, katas, and the wisdom of ages:
	* Program in the open:
	* Learn by teaching others:
* Read a book
* Read source code (i.e. for rails, backbone, underscore, or anything that you use).
* Every bug you fix is a level up, but you have to understand why it happened. (Root cause analysis)
* Listen to podcasts (railscasts, Ruby Rogues, etc)
* Understand that all programming happens in a domain. Learn the domain you're working in well, and own it.
* Take responsibility for the code that you write. Be professional.
* Focus on quality.

## 5:10 - Effort (Andy)

You all have accomplished so much in such a little time, but what’s next? There’s always a “next".. But before we go into what “next” maybe is for you all, I’d like to share a rather personal story of mine.

A little less than a decade ago, I was not doing so well. I was attending Virginia Tech at the time and things we’re not going swimmingly. I stopped taking care of myself, stopped attending classes. I just played video games, partied a lot and did other .. recreational activities. You may even say I hit that proverbial rock bottom. It was the lowest point I had ever been in my life. My thought at the time was, I need to change myself and I need some sort of stimulus to start this process. So I joined the army.

I remember being at a hotel that the army put me up in the day before I was shipped to basic training. I also vividly remembering making a mental decision to give the army everything I had. Every ounce of motivation, every drop of dedication went into making me the best damn Soldier I could be. And so I did. I excelled in the Army  and as I matured and developed not only as a Soldier but also as an adult, I realized that this mindset, the one that allowed me to excel as   a Soldier, was also the mindset I should have for the rest of my life. Since that first day of basic training my life has been challenging, but extremely rewarding.

You guys have all gotten to this point because you tried really hard and were challenged during your time in GA! Now’s the time to maintain that mindset of a lifelong learner for what’s next. So what’s next? It doesn’t matter what’s next. I can guarantee that the efforts you put into what’s next is the most important. At the end of the day, you, yourself are accountable for the things that happen in your life. Make the most of it, and make what happens NEXT, awesome.
