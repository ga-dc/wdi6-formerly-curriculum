# APIs, AJAX and Express

## Learning Objectives

### APIs
- Describe what an API is, and why we might use one.
- Explain the common role of JSON on the web.
- Describe the purpose and syntax of `respond_to`
- Make a Rails app that provides a JSON API.
- Use an external API (via HTTParty) to gather data and utilize it in a Rails application

### Ajax
- Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous program execution
- Explain why synchronous program execution is not conducive to the front-end.
- Use jQuery `$.ajax()` method to make asynchronous GET requests for data.
- Distinguish between a callback and a promise.
- Use jQuery's 'promise-like' methods to handle AJAX responses asynchronously.
- Render new HTML content using data loaded from an Ajax request.
- Perform POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to an API to modify data.

### Javascript Prototypes and Constructors

- Explain the importance of OOJS in front-end code
- Describe the role of constructor functions, and how they work
- Use constructor functions and the `new` keyword to create objects with shared properties (like classes)
- Describe what a prototype object is, and how they are used in JS
- Differentiate between `__proto__` and Animal.prototype
- Diagram the relationship between an object, its constructor, and prototype
- Compare `Object.create` vs constructors
- Compare / contrast classical and prototypal inheritance
- Use the Chrome element inspector to traverse through the prototypal tree.

### Express

- Compare and contrast Javascript in the browser vs JS on the server
- Compare and contrast express JS to Rails && Sinatra.
- Use npm to manage project dependencies
- Use module.exports and require to organize code
- Use Handlebars templates to simplify rendering on the back-end
- Use and configure middleware like body-parser to handle form submissions
- Link to static assets in an Express application
