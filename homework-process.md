# Homework

## The submission process

All homework assignments will have their own Github repository, under the `ga-dc` account.

1. Please **fork** new assignments. 
2. Then, **clone** your fork to your computer. 
3. Create a feature branch in the format of `yourname_solution`
4. Complete your work inside it. 
5. Then, **push** your completed work to your forked repository. 
6. Finally, make a **pull request** to the upstream repository (in `ga-dc`).

**Even if you're not done, please make sure you've made a pull request with what you have completed by the times listed below.**

## What to include with your submission

On **every submission** -- that is, on every pull request (or, sometimes, issue) -- please include:
- **Comfort score**, out of 5
- **Completeness score**, out of 5
- On what **specific concept or piece of code** you would like feedback

We'd love to go through and add comments to your code in its entirety, but that's extremely time-consuming. Please let us know with what specific things you are most concerned and we'll focus our review there.

If you would like feedback on something that isn't working, please follow the format:

>I tried this:

>I expected this to happen:

>This happened instead: (**Include error messages**)


Finally, if you'd like feedback or an answer to a question from an instructor *other* than the one assigned to check your submission (see below), please include their first name in your pull request / issue.
